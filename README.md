***
## Welcome!
If you’re reading this, it means we’re interested in working with you in 99minutos.com and solving amazing and difficult problems in shipping for online shopping tech in Latam.

This README provides the instructions to a small, self-contained test for a supervised Frontend position.

## What we're looking for
We're looking for a talented and driven frontend developer, comfortable with building responsive front end experiences.

Experience building responsive, elegant and scalable web applications; understand cross-browser/platform compatibility issues.

# 📦 Front-End Challenge
This is a quick coding supervised challenge we designed to assess your qualifications as a potential front-end developer. It's important to note that this is by no means a test. We just want to get a sense of how you write code and solve problems.

## Getting started
To get started with this challenge: 
1) Fork this repository.
2) Create a branch with the name: ``yourlevel-yourname``, example: ``JR-joaosilva``
3) When you finish, make a pull request with name ``yourname``, example ``João Silva`` and add a tag with your level (JR/PL/SR).

## About the project
This is a project created with **Next.js**

Install all the packages

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/containers](http://localhost:3000/api/containers).

## The Challenge
We'll be looking for **simple and well-designed** component in the submission.
