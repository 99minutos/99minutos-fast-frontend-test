# ðŸ“¦ Front-End Challenge
This is a quick coding supervised challenge we designed to assess your qualifications as a potential front-end developer. It's important to note that this is by no means a test. We just want to get a sense of how you write code and solve problems.

2) Clone this repository.
3) Create a branch with the name: ``yourlevel-yourname``, example: ``JR-joaosilva``
4) When you finish, make a pull request with name ``yourname``, example ``JoÃ£o Silva`` and add a tag with your level (JR/MD/SR).

```bash
npm run dev
